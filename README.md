# Linux Kernel Internals

A community hub for understanding the Linux kernel — documentation and discussions about design decisions, internals, and the journey of contributing.

## What This Is

**Documentation**: Deep dives into kernel subsystems, explaining *why* things work the way they do, not just the APIs.

**Discussion**: A place to ask questions, share discoveries, and help each other understand the kernel.

## Why?

The kernel has extensive API documentation, but understanding the *rationale* requires digging through mailing list archives, scattered articles, and tribal knowledge. We're building a more accessible resource.

## Documentation

| Subsystem | Status | Start Here |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| [mm/](docs/mm/) | Available | [Overview](docs/mm/overview.md) |
| scheduler/ | Planned | |
| networking/ | Planned | |
| bpf/ | Planned | |
